There are three general approaches to code splitting available:
    * Entry Points: Manually split code using entry configuration.
    * Prevent Duplication: Use the SplitChunksPlugin to dedupe and split chunks.
    * Dynamic Imports: Split code via inline function calls within modules.

    The SplitChunksPlugin allows us to extract common dependencies into an existing entry chunk or an entirely new chunk.
